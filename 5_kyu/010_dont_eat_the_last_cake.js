/**
 * Welcome Warrior! Let's play a game!
 * You've gotten challenged by a lot of kata, now it's time for you to challenge the kata!
 * Inside a room, there is a table with a pile of cakes. One of these cakes is filled
 * with poison. Every turn, we will take cakes from this pile and eat them, leaving
 * the last one to be the poisonous cake. Whoever eats the poisonous cake will die.
 * The poisonous cake is clearly marked, so you do not have to guess. Rather you need
 * to rely on your logic to save you.
 *
 * The rules are simple:
 * 1. Do not eat the last cake. It's obivious that poisonous cake will be the last
 *    to be eaten, so, DON'T EAT THE LAST CAKE. Try to make your opponent eat it.
 * 2. When it is your turn, you can only take one, two or three cakes. The same rules
 *    apply to your opponent on there turn. You cannot skip your move, so choose wisely
 *    how many cakes to eat. Both opponents will be able to see how many cakes the other
 *    eats on each turn.
 * 3.
