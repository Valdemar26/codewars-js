/**
 * In the United States, one of the most important days of the year is colloquially
 * known as "Black Friday". On this day, millions of pilgrims sojourn to their local
 * centers of capitalism to stand in long lines and trade currency for flat-screen TVs
 * and two-dollar DVDs.
 *
 * Black Friday—so-called because on this day some retailers' accounting books move from
 * "the red" (having net losses) to "the black" (having net profits)—is traditionally
 * celebrated on the day immediately following the American Thanksgiving holiday, which always
 * falls on the fourth Thursday in November.
 *
 * You have recently been hired by a large boat retailer, Beast Bouy, who wants to know exactly
 * what date they can expect shoppers to crowd their store and purchase their stocks of moderately
 * discounted jet-skis. Your first task at this job is create a blackFriday function which accepts
 * an integer year, and returns the day of the month of November that Black Friday falls on in that year.
 * Your function only needs to support years after 1752*.
 *
 * This happens to be the year that the British Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar.
 * The Javascript Date object uses an extrapolated Gregorian calendar, meaning it is
 * not necessarily accurate to reality for dates in the far past.
